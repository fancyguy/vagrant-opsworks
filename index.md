A [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) plugin that configures a multi vm environment based on a defined stack in [AWS OpsWorks](http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/). This is helpful in rapidly spinning up a copy of a production environment without needing to maintain the configuration in multiple locations.
